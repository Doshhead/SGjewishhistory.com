        <h1>SG Jewish History</h1>
        <h2>The <strong><i>Accurate</i></strong> Jewish History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The 10 Plagues(מכת)are some of the biggest miracles in the Torah(תורה).They Include:</p>
          <li>Blood(דָם)</li>
          <li>Frogs(צפרדעים)</li>
          <li>Lice(כִּנִים)</li>
          <li>Wild Animals(ערב)</li>
          <li>Dead Animals(דבר)</li>
          <li>Boils(שחין)</li>
          <li>Hail(בָּרָד)</li>
          <li>Locusts(ארבה)</li>
          <li>Darkness(חוֹשֶׁך)</li>
          <li>Death of The First Borns(מכת בוכרות)</li>
        <p>These Plagues are very easy to not believe.There is proof for all of these plagues.</p>
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus(see picture below)is a papyrus written in ancient Eygptian.</p>
        <p>When the Ipuwer Papyrus was translated it talked about drought,starvation,etc.</p>
        <p>Subsequently the Ipuwer Papyrus was compared to the Torah and they were extremely similar.</p>
        <img src="Papyrus_van_Ipoewer_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"alt= "Ipuwer Papyrus" align="right">
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus states this:"<i>Plague is throughout the land. Blood is everywhere.</i>"(2:5-6)</p>
        <p>The Torah states this:"<i>all the waters of the river were turned to blood.(7:20)</i>
        <p>Another quote from the Ipuwer Papyrus is:"<i>The river is blood. As you drink it you lose your humanity and thirst for water.</i>(2:10)</p>
        <p>Another quote from the Torah is:"<i>Egypt will grow weary of trying to drink water from the river.</i>"(7:18)</p>
        <p>Now when we compare the quotes from the Ipuwer Papyrus and from the Torah we see that they are the same thing but from different points of view.</p>
        <p>This is proof for the plague of blood.</p>
        <hr> 
        <p>The next plague is frogs.</p>
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus:"<i>O that the earth would cease from the noise and tumult be no more</i>"(6:1)</p>
        <p>According to the Zohar(זהר) because of the loud noise from the frogs nobody can hear anybody and the babies and children died.(Vol 2,30)</p>
        <p>This is proof for the plague of frogs.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus states:"<i>All animals,their hearts weep"</i>(5:5)</p>
        <p>The Torah states:"<i>The hand of G-d is upon the cattle which is in the field...and there shall be a very grievious sickness"</i>(9:3)</p>
        <p>This is proof for the plague of Dead Animals</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus states:"<i>Lower Egypt weeps...The entire palace is without its revenues.to it belong wheat and barley geese and fish"</i>(10:3-6)</p>
        <p>The Torah staes:"<i>And the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field"</i>(9:25)</p>
        <p>This is not only proof for the plague of hail but also the Torah says that the Jews lived in upper Egypt(גשן) and none of the plagues effected the land. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus says:"<i>The land is in darkness"</i>(9:11)</p>
        <p>The Torah says:"<i>And there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt"</i>(10:22)</p>
        <p>This is proof for the plague of darkness.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus says:"<i>A man looks upon his son as his enemy</i>(1:6)</p>
        <p>According to the Midrash(מדרש) when the Egyptians were warned about the plague the firstborns told their fathers to free the Jews but they didnt.As a result the Egyptian firstborns killed their fathers by sword.</p>
        <p>This is proof for the plague of death of the firstborns</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>...............................................................................................................<b>BONUS</b>...........................................................................................................................</h2>
        <h3>Exodus</h3>
        <p>The Ipuwer Papyrus states:"<i>Gold and lapis lazuli,silver and malachite,carnelian and bronze...are fastened on the neck of female slaves"</i>(3:2)</p>
        <p>The Torah states:'<i>Each women shall request from her neighbor and the lodger in her house objects of silver,gold,and clothing..."</i>(3:22)</p>
        <p>Again when we compare we see that its the same thing but from a different point of view.</p>
        <p>This is proof for Exodus.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>All of this is undeniable proof that the miracles listed above are prooven correct.</p>
        <p>I hope this report helped you understand that nothing the Torah is untrue.</p>
